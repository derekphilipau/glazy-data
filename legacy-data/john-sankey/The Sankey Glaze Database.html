<h2>The Sankey Glaze Database</h2>
<p>
Version 13 June 2008
</p><p>
This database is a tribute to Alisa Clausen of Denmark, who has tested most of the glazes
presented here in a consistent way and so generously shared her work with the world.
</p><p>
All glazes in this database have published formulae and have been tested as noted. Essentially all
of Clausens tests were done substituting Johnson Matthey frit 169 on a gram for gram basis for
Gerstley borate and for all boron frits, also substituting Feldshammer feldspar for listed
feldspars. All glazes are for electric (oxidizing) firing unless otherwise stated. Almost all
were published on the ClayArt mailing list.
</p><p>
Glazes with similar compositions have been merged using the alternate names field. Names have been regularized to avoid
duplication, to include the surname of the originator and the colour. Ingredients are as published and often do not add to 100,
with or without colorants. Proprietary ingredients have been replaced by generic names when appropriate; for example Zircopax and
Ultrox are both zirconia. Many old names are used for common pottery ingredients - a single one for each is used here with preference
given to standard chemical names. For example all modern flint of which I am aware is refined silica, whiting is now pure calcium
carbonate. Following modern requirements, glazes with lead or cadmium are excluded; those with more than 10% BaO are labelled as
potentially toxic.

example the related <a href="http://www.johnsankey.ca/glazeanalysis.html">glaze analysis page</a>. It is also designed to be imported into any well-designed
database system. As a result, the database proper has to avoid all HTML markup, so is included in a PRE container. When viewing

H: Bill Merrill: one of the lowest melting glazes I have used. Use copper for floating tints, try everything with this glaze! Fired a little
higher it is clear and reveals the clay body colour. I have used this glaze on and off since 1970.

H: Alisa Clausen: fired to cone 6. Use 3% manganese for light orange, 6% for strong orange and 10% for a dark red. Apply thickly, up
to 1/4 inch to yield red, thinner yields black. As pretty much expected, at cone 6 the glaze ran off the test tile (which was only glazed
1/3 of the way down) and pooled at the bottom edge of the upright tile. I was just interested to see how much.

H: Alisa Clausen: fired to cone 6. Mat, smooth and covering glaze. Colour ranges from a deep and bright blue where thickest to a
turquoise where thinner. I wanted to see if a glaze made up a glaze core, nepheline syenite and an alkaline earth flux, barium
carbonate, and no boron, could fire higher and not run off the test. It succeeded. It seems that this combination could be fired even
higher. At 1220C feels and looks mature.

H: Steve Slatin: some of the Cushing glazes are formulated for the far edge of what works. My favourite, Rusty Bronze done as green
runs at cone 6, and if you have a cool at all slow it gets very matte, but if you turn off your kiln at cone 5½ and do a fast cool, you get a
fabulous mix of glossy where thick and microcrystalline with a nice texture shift where thin. And one percent of bentonite in the glaze
bucket just changes it entirely.

E: 9 calcium carbonate
E: 8 talc
F: gloss
H: Alisa Clausen: the original was 4 parts by volume frit, 4 parts EPK, 2 parts silica, 2 parts feldspar, 1 part calcium carbonate, 1 part
talc. Transparent gloss, colours very well. I think the sheer spectrum of colours that resulted from this base, gives a good incentive for
those who seek not to have many, many glazes in their studios, but rather a couple of bases they can colour. Personally, I think that is
an excellent idea, as I too, have two to three bases that I use regularly, and colour as I need them. I usually have a few kilos dry glaze
of each base, so that I can mix smaller amounts with colouring oxides. This base liked RIO, Titanium and Rutile, giving some very
exciting colour responses. 5 rutile, and 1 Cobalt, 4 Rutile, 2 RIO showed very nice breaking contrasts in colour. 10 RIO yielded an
especially beautiful Tenmoku glaze, with dramatic breaking contrasts.
With 1 cobalt oxide, translucent vivid blue.
With 2 cobalt oxide, translucent darker vivid blue.
With 3 rutile plus 1 cobalt oxide, translucent brownish green ground, with vivid opalescent blue areas where thickest.
With 3 red iron oxide plus1 cobalt oxide, translucent, brownish green.
With 5 ochre plus 1 cobalt oxide, translucent, dark blue glaze with a slightly black denim cast.
With 3 rutile, semi translucent glaze, creamy beige to yellow colour. White and slightly opalescent shell over ground colour.
With 5 rutile, opaque, gloss, soft white glaze, breaking beige. The glaze appearance goes from white where thickest, to a breaking
colour where the thick white disperses to tiny bubbles of white, which gives a fur appearance, and then finally all of the white
disappearing to yield a beige gloss, where it is at its thinnest.
With 3 rutile plus 3 copper carbonate, translucent, sage green (muddy celadon) gloss, breaking clear.
With 3 copper carbonate, translucent, medium green, gloss. Many translucent areas without much colour in ground green colour.
With 4 rutile plus 2 red iron oxide plus 1 cobalt oxide, opaque, light blue gloss glaze with some yellowish streaking where thickest,
over a brown ground with a green cast, where thinnest and breaking. Glaze breaks with a dramatic colour contrast from brown where
thinnest, to a smooth, milky blue where thickest. These colorants are the same as Floating Blue or Blue Hare.
With 10 red iron oxide, opaque, gloss glaze that is a tenmoku colour. Overall, the glaze is a deep black, flushed with brown where
thinner or breaking. The brown areas have broken and dispersed edges as it they lead into the thicker black areas.
With 5 red iron oxide, semi opaque, gloss glaze. Overall dark brown colour where thickest, lighter brown similar to above where
thinner. Breaking contrast is not as dramatic as above.
With 10 ochre, translucent gloss, glaze. Greenish yellow in overall cast.
With 10 tin dioxide, opaque, gloss, soft white glaze.
With 10 zirconia, opaque, gloss white glaze. Not as white as Tin, but slightly creamy in colour.
With 10 titanium dioxide, semi opaque to translucent gloss, glaze. White where thickest, giving way to a yellow ground under the
white, where thinnest. Breaks, in high contrast to the white areas, a yellow-green to orange colour.
With 5 titanium dioxide plus 5 red iron oxide, semi opaque, gloss glaze. Medium brown ground where thinnest, fur-like beige and
green where thickest. Breaks brown.
With 3 black nickel oxide, semi opaque, gloss glaze, dark caramel in colour. Where slightly thicker, glaze is more fluid and pools to a
bluish green fur like surface.
With 1 tin dioxide plus 1 cobalt oxide, translucent, gloss dark blue glaze.
With 5 red iron oxide plus 2 cobalt oxide, opaque, gloss glaze. Black where thinnest, begins to turn browner where thickest.
With 10 zinc oxide plus 2 black nickel oxide, opaque, gloss glaze. Medium caramel ground colour where thinnest. Signs of
bluish-green pooling where thickest.
H: Ron Roy: the expansion of this glaze is high enough I would expect occasional crazing and/or crazing when the glaze is thick on
many clay bodies. I also expect some crazing during a fast cool when thick, even if the glaze expansion is low enough to not craze
otherwise.

F: matte
H: Alisa Clausen: a covering white satin matt, very similar to the ToDo white I use often. Some areas with narrow rivulets of compact,
tight crystals. Oxides Cobalt, RIO, black stain, Chrome and Ocher showed well but muted under the glaze, with mostly diffused edges.
The Chrome is a dark tan. The glaze is thick and white, a soft white, not a stark white. It has a nice smooth feel and is matt without
being dry. It is almost waxy. Same glaze test made with local frit subbed for G.B. with similar results. This test showed a very similar
glaze and oxide effect, however glaze is slightly glossier than the recipe with G.B. With 1 cobalt oxide, very similar to Lotte Blue. A
lavender blue with darker blues where thinner, more pink and lavender where thickest. A lot of nuances throughout the matt surface.
With 3 rutile plus 1 cobalt oxide, a mottled light blue glaze with light green splotching. Although the surface has a lot of colour play,
over all, it has a pale blue colour. Interesting mild colour changes from pale blue to pale green where thickest and from brown to dark
blue where thinnest.
With 5 red iron oxide, this was surprising, an overall tan glaze with fairly bright but dirty yellow streaking. The glaze is matt but where
thickest (yellow), it has a glimmer. I have seen RIO in many shades of tans and browns and reds, but this is very yellow, like a summer
squash.
H: John Sankey: this glaze is very low in silica for stability.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Frit 623 for Frit 3124. With 5 rutile plus 3 tin dioxide, smooth, rutile yellow/beige gloss. On test with clay that
has iron flecks, flecks were very visible under glaze. Where the glaze is thinner, it is overall slightly more beige than yellow. Where
thickets, it becomes a lighter, brighter yellow. Where thick and thin meet, there are smooth streaks of yellow. Very well melted.
With 10 titanium dioxide plus 5 rutile, same as with tin, but slightly less streaking, slightly less white in outer edges of streaks.
With 20 titanium dioxide plus 10 rutile, glaze is stiffer. No streaking.

H: Alisa Clausen: With 15 red iron oxide, gloss glaze with many colour nuances. Rust brown base with streaking in darker browns and
slightly green browns. Edges have a bluer nuance. Some areas under surface are honey brown. Where very thick, the glaze ran in large
drips. Moved and pooled where very thick, but otherwise stayed where dipped.
With 5 red iron oxide, semi matte glaze that is yellowier where thicker, browner where thinner. Many nuances, did not move.
With 10 ochre, overall yellowish glaze where thicker, shiny. Where thinner, browner and matter. Where very thick, it crazed.
With 3 cobalt carbonate, lavender semi matte glaze where thickest, bluer where thinner. With 5 rutile plus 3 cobalt carbonate, medium
green semi gloss base with bright, cornflower blue crystals where thicker. Lovely contrasts.
With 5 rutile plus 5 red iron oxide plus 3 cobalt carbonate, similar to above, but some movement where the edges of glaze are dark
blue. Glaze is more fluid, instead of distinct crystals like above, the lighter blue is in streaks.

With 6 black copper oxide plus 0.5 cobalt carbonate, a semi matt, mottled, smooth surface. The overall colour is a medium green with
a bluish nuance. Very well covering.
With 0.5 cobalt carbonate, a gloss, cobalt blue that is uniform where thickest.
With 6 tin dioxide plus 2 cobalt carbonate, a gloss, mottled, medium blue/violet. Well covering where thickest.
With 12 ochre, a gloss, yellow glaze where thickest and browner where thinner. Well covering and smooth.
With 6 rutile plus 3 red iron oxide plus 1 cobalt carbonate, a gloss, medium brown. Where thickest the glaze has a paler fuzzing on the
surface.
H: John Sankey: bleached all red Mason stains I tried with not even a trace of colour left, but works well with their yellows and
browns.

H: John Sankey: A very even colour as long as it is thicker than 50 um, red crystals on a black ground with visual depth. It tends to
black where it is thin. By far the most reliable of the iron reds I have tried. The expansion is high, but it works perfectly on my clay,
which is fairly low expansion, probably due to the high potash content, which increases both elasticity and tensile strength.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Johnson Matthey J frit instead of 3134, kaolin instead of china clay. Applied thick. A mat glaze that is well
melted and very smooth surface. The colour is a strong aqua green. The glaze is well covering and has a slight sheen, although mat.
Where it is thicker, has more sheen than where thinner, but green in both areas. Has a lush and thick look overall. Tested same glaze
with ball clay instead of kaolin. Resulted in a very similar glaze, but is slightly darker in overall colour. It is not as uniform in colour or
as bright as the recipe with kaolin. It has an appearance that the aqua colour is higher surface, over a darker ground. With kaolin the
glaze has an even colour, with ball clay, there is more colour play on the surface.

Please note that Ron Roy suspects that this glaze could break down in the dishwasher, due to its low alumina.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Johnson Matthey J frit instead of 3134, local kaolin instead of Grolleg. Applied thick. With 3% copper
carbonate: a mat glaze with a dry but well melted surface. Colour is green to grey where thickest brown where thinner. Resembles the
original Weathered Bronze, but greyer overall. There are green flecks that break through the surface of the glaze. 4% copper: Much
greener overall with many green flecks joining over a grayish ground surface colour. Small crystals are more obvious on surface and
has a slightly lichen effect in some areas where thicker. 5% copper: The green specs are brighter. Therefore there is a stronger contrast
between them and the grey ground. The ground is browner where thinner, but the green is as strong.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Johnson Matthey J frit instead of 3134, local kaolin instead of Grolleg. Applied thick. A semi mat with
movement in the surface. The glaze looks similar to the original Weathered Bronze where thinnest, but with a better melt and therefore
slightly more gloss. However, where thickest, this is the brightest of greens of all of the Pinnell new formulations of Weathered
Bronze. It is a strong aqua to grass green, with movement in the surface, showing some minute whitish streaking. It is black and green
where thinnest. John Hesselberth has tested this glaze for copper leaching and recommends this glaze for decorative use only.

always mixed this glaze with ball clay instead of the kaolin in the recipe. The glaze acts much better for me with ball clay than kaolin.

glaze, with distinct colour differences from thick to thin. Has shino-like flecked and speckled look where thickest.
H: John Post: a speckled rust glaze where thin, turning into a creamy beige glaze if it is applied more thickly. Great in combination
with Berry Rust. Works at cone 6-7. In reduction at cone 7 it turned an unattractive speckled grey. I tried using less tin in order to cut
the cost of the glaze, but the glaze was not opaque enough with 3% or 6% tin. At 9% the glaze was opaque, but did not have the
creamy brightness of the glaze with 13%. I also tried 15% superpax instead of the tin, but that glaze test turned the rust colour a dull
brown and the left the creamy areas looking dingy.

G: crawls
H: Alisa Clausen: The glaze pulled, separated and crawled from the underlying glaze of contrasting colour (I used Nutmeg) making a
high and textured lichen effect. The glaze is slightly dry and although the effect is very textured, it separated into islands with sharper
borders than the rounder, ball like islands I was aiming for. With the fine help of Bacia, I was able to get this glaze to work this far,
because she told me that it must be applied very thickly, until it crackles a bit when dried, but to much so that it will fall off the pot as
you lift it into the kiln. There is a lot to experiment with this glaze. It can also be coloured with stains and oxides.

H: Alisa Clausen: used local red clay instead of OM-4. Gloss glaze with shino like colorations. The glaze is a rust brown where
thinnest and pools cream where thickest. Overall appearance is a rust glaze with streaks and patches of cream. A glaze that breaks
well. This version is slightly rustier in colour than the original version, but not very much so. Smooth to the feel.

G: crawls
H: Alisa Clausen: Application is crucial to get this glaze to crawl. It must be applied thickly enough that there are slight cracks in the
dried surface. I brushed it on. Glossy, white islands, like drops of school glue (Elmer for the Americans). The individual islands were
different in overall sizes, from 1cm or less to a healthy 2 centimeters in diameter. They are varied in shape from round to oblong. The
islands sit high above the clay surface and are smooth to the touch. Over a commercial 04 black, the glaze melted into the glaze, still
forming distinct islands. The island edges are more geometric, like oatmeal, however still very distinct. The are not as raised as the
Texture crawl by itself, but still raised about the surface of the black glaze. The black glaze pooled and formed a border around each
island. Over Lili Krakowski Albany Slip substitution, the glaze is more covering and is more lichen like as opposed to raised islands.
The overall surface is a labyrinth of white flattened shapes of all forms, revealing the slip only where the shapes are separated by their
crevice like borders. The glaze lies almost flat, but has a very distinct lichen pattern like the pattern of our brain tissue. Lana sprays it
on.

H: Alisa Clausen: Gloss glaze that is rust red where thinnest. It pooled very glassy with a crystallized yellowish surface. There is a red
spot in the middle of the test tile. I have tested this glaze twice, both on white and on brown stoneware. Both times, the glaze showed a
well melted, multi coloured gloss. The glaze was an more overall yellowish brown on the brown stoneware. Smooth and slightly more
of a semi gloss. I glazed the insides of several pots with this glaze. The glaze literally popped off the slides of the pot in big chunks and
splinters. This is the first time I have witnessed a glaze shiver so severely minutes after the pots were unloaded. They continued to
shiver in small splinters a day after. Now I have thrown them away, carefully, but they could still be pinging and popping. The test tiles
are from very recently and from over a year ago. They have not shivered.

H: Alisa Clausen: The application of this glaze is crucial. It must be applied thickly enough that it dries with slight cracks over the
dried surface. This recipe is very similar to Kemp Lichen, with the addition of Zinc Oxide. The glaze forms small, close, irregularly
shaped curdles. They are have a more mat surface than the Kemp recipe. The addition of Zinc also makes the overall glaze slightly
drier and the edges of the curdles are slightly lifted. The overall feel is craggy and rough. It resembles lichen moss and although the
edges are lifted, they are fused. With 3% added Rutile has slightly larger lichen forms, colour is the same. Over Commercial Black
cone 04 glaze the curdles smoothed out, are in general larger and glossier. The Black glaze pools in between the curdles.

Colour is a truly mellow yellow orange. On closer look at the surface, there is some pitting, but cannot feel it. The glaze has an area
that is darker and toastier than rest of test tile. An unusual colour, as it is very much in the yellow family.

true mat. The colour is not as yellow orange, but is still in the same family. It is a slightly whiter yellow orange, with slightly less depth
of colour and warmth than Dry Yellow Pumpkin. However, an unusual yellow orange, and no pitting.

However, the surface is so attractive, and in strong light, there is an orange spec. This is a glaze I will further test. I found from my
work with red clay glazes, the difference of a flux or spar can make vast variations in surface colour. Using Crocus Martis instead of
iron oxide,red gives the same silk mat surface, covering glaze. Colour is a green brown where thickest and brown where thinnest.

milky white, silky, well melted, semi mat. The glaze is slightly more reflective than Selsor Waxy White, but still mat, with a very
smooth feel to the surface. Just makes me want to pass the test tile across my cheek.
H: John Sankey: white with a definite beige cast, faintly rough silk matte, more matte than Selsor Waxy White when both are fired

H: Alisa Clausen: used equal volumes as specified by Tony, weights as shown. A clear, transparent gloss.
H: Cindy Strnad: the reason you get a matte finish is the formation of calcium crystals. For this, you need a slow cooling cycle. I get a
nice buttery matte with a slight tendency toward shallow pinholes, and a subdued medium-dark blue on brown clay when cooling at
55C per hour down to 540C.
H: Alisha Clarke: a very good and stable glaze base that can be used with many colorants, a good starting point for someone just
getting into mixing their own glazes. The recipe is simple and easy to mix up.

H: Cindy Strnad: developed from Hansen 20x5 and one from Ron Roy, to avoid the tendency to pinhole with Hansen. But, with Ron
base, the glaze was closer to a baby blue, and I wanted dark. So I fiddled around with it to bring the numbers nearer to those in Tony
glaze, and this is what I came up with. No pinholes so far.

H: Alisa Clausen: Gloss, transparent glaze. Described as a great liner glaze in article. I would choose something else, without barium
and without so much Gerstley. I made this glaze with a boron frit instead of G. B. and the result looked the same, with a very good
melt. I would suggest also subbing strontium for the barium. That would get rid of the barium and since there are no colour enhancing
issues, (where I have found strontium not to be as good as catalyst as barium) it could be a success. 100 gr. barium carbonate equals
74.8 gr. strontium carbonate (6.5 gr. s.c. for this recipe).

Lana advises can run where very thick, but did not on tile. Where thickest yields bronze. My test shows pretty much an even green
with some variations in thick and thin. Can be applied over a white lichen glaze (Mark Bell). My test showed a lighter green overall.
Wilson says anywhere between 4-8 copper oxide may be used.

H: John Sankey: this glaze gets its texture from calcite decomposition at 870°C (it is 40% CO2) followed by silicon carbide
decomposition when alkalis in the glaze melt releasing more CO2 bubbles, and by being underfired therefore very stiff at cone 6. With
10g Mason 6600 stain, looks like volcanic rock. Very rough surface, non-functional, most suitable for large scale pieces, but
spectacular.

H: John Sankey: a fluid glaze that can be applied very thin and still seal evenly. Good for applying over non-toxic underglaze, but has
too little silica to be functional with any colorant that could cause problems if it leached. Its expansion is high, but it withstands the
usual freezer to boiling water test when dipped thinly on my stoneware. It will be safest on high-expansion clays.

H: Candice Roeder: a deep blue-brown background of great depth with lighter mottled blues that seem to float on the surface of the
background glaze. with more of the lighter mottled blues where the application is thickest. Watch thickness near the bottom of the pot.
It fires best on the light side of cone 6 (standard cone just bending), seems to get greener and more fluid the higher you go. Cone 5
works well, too. The book says to weigh the ingredients very carefully, use distilled water or water that is known to have a low mineral
content. Mix then add the CMC solution. The book warns that the glaze is fickle, and recommends against firing this glaze in the same
kiln with glazes that contain copper, chrome, nickel or manganese. Mineral content of the water is an important factor. I have noticed
an adverse effect as the author noted, and now fire an entire kiln load of this glaze.
H: Martha Muzychka: not what I expected, mostly green with a few spots of blue. On black stoneware clay, it gives an unusual cloudy
effect.
H: Ivy Glasgow: a popular and beautiful (when done right) glaze. The original Floating Blue pigments have been tested and found to
be food safe. When floating blue works, it is lovely. Key seems to be firing to no more than Cone 5-1/2 and cooling quickly.
H: James Chappell: the colours seem to float on a surface of a darker background of great depth, reminiscent of a deep pool of water.
Its colour and opacity vary greatly with thickness so it highlights irregularities in the surface. Phase separation in the translucent matrix
makes the colour swirl as small rivulets of more fluid glass flow around more viscous phases. Titanium crystals in the matrix make it
sparkle. Calcium-borate boron-blue crystals grow on the surface. Bubbles of escaping gases create pools of lighter coloured glass
surrounded by darker rings. Small black speckles are produced by unground particles of iron. Use distilled or low mineral water, force
all material through an 80 mesh screen, stir thoroughly before and during use to prevent settling out of the iron content, apply the
thickness of a dime, fire to cone 6 oxidation exactly, and cool normally. Do not substitute any other chemicals for those given, it is a
fickle glaze. It depends on the Gerstley borate to suspend it.

H: Martha Muzychka: not nice at all, very pale with brown streaks. With 1.5 copper carbonate and 0.25 cobalt oxide, breaks to an icky
greyish brown where thick.
H: Alisa Clausen: With 3 copper carbonate, shiny green overall with dark (not esp. pink) speckles in bottom of test bowl. I like this
green very much, very bright and clear like the green on a Macintosh apple or a darkish celedon, and there is no G.B. I think this glaze
would complement a speckled iron clay body nicely for some real play in the surface.

H: Wendy Moore: on porcelain at cone 10 in reduction, a beautiful brown/burgundy/gold, almost a hares fur looking glaze. It has

H: Cindy Strnad: used 3134 frit instead of 3124. A beautiful, pale variegated green-turquoise where thin, non-variegated where thicker.
I liked the thin bits best. Dipping a rather too-large test bowl in a rather too-small test glaze container makes for a lot of variegations in
thickness, and this added to the interest of the finished surface. Leach tests unusually stable for a copper-containing glaze.

H: Cindy Strnad: a variegated black and metallic copper surface, absolutely stunning. This glaze is high on alumina, low on silica, high
in lithium. It would not be suitable for food--it does not even look like something I would want to eat food from, but it is gorgeous.
H: Ian Macmillan: works beautifully for me and looks very impressive. It is a slightly runny, patchy glaze, mostly a shiny copper with
patches of dull brown. My friends find it fascinating.

H: Alisa Clausen: A keeper for my pallet, very good colour and surface results, a mottled, light yellow-green, shiny surface. Where
thicker, the green is more pronounced but has very soft edges, fading into the a yellowish ground. Brown edges where thin. A
transparent glaze over it brought up more browns. A glaze with many colour nuances and nice flat surface.

H: Alisa Clausen: used plain kaolin instead of calcined. Produced a shiny grey, I believe I used too little cobalt. I have only a whole

difference from thick to thin.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Cornwall stone for P.V. Clay. An opaque cream under very shiny clear. Interesting structure under the gloss.
Nice flat surface, evenly melted. When applied over Wolff Plum, a shiny, smooth honey brown gloss, with beautiful opalescent
breaking over the high areas and where it pooled, beautiful, fluid changes of colour all over the vessel. I mixed my batch a little thick
to test for dripping and even with two layers of reasonably thick glazes, it pooled to a bright opalescence, but did not drip off the foots
of the pots. I am really impressed with this combination as it is the type of surface I personally like very much for decorative vessels.

H: Alisa Clausen: a semigloss red. I was surprised by the depth of colour. It is a deep wine red. It broke more or less clear where it is
thin, making a mottled red/body-colour covering. I think this glaze will be exciting to try on a porcelain for a fake reduced red. Needs
to be applied evenly for dark colour, such as dipped. Smooth surface. The Clay Times version added 0.25 cobalt carbonate.

glossy, and milky and glossy where thickest. Inside of cup is a consistent, smooth gloss.

H: Alisa Clausen: a deep iron brown glossy glaze with some speckling. This glaze in oxidation resembles Wolff Plum. It could be a
good substitute for that glaze when the G.B. runs out. It has a nice surface with some play in the colour, due to the lighter spots. Where
it was thickest over the rim of the test cup, it had a rougher surface with very slight craters. No dripping or running.

H: Alisa Clausen: used Cornwall stone for Vitrox. A golden brown, glossy, glaze. It pooled a lot in the center of the test bowl, but did
not drip on the outside. The pool is creamy, shiny opaque, with large floating crystals and an opalescent ring around the pool. Very
nice. In between the blue ring and the pool is a second ring of whiter, very small crystals.

Pinholing where thickest. A lot of movement in the glaze surface over the lip of the test bowl. Varied greatly depending on thickness
of application from streaked brown gloss where thin, to deep, pinholed cognac colour where thickest.

heavy streaking of oranges and whites some of the bases produced with 10% ochre in my trials. I prefer this more homogenized colour
ground to a lot of commotion on the surface. Darker where thinner, lighter where thicker. Good effect over throwing rings.

H: Alisa Clausen: CM says a speckled blue, produces a variety of blues and browns when used with Plum and Cream. A stable, gloss
bluish/grey even glaze for me. Over Wolff Plum, it did its thing as described in the Ceramics Monthly, with a lot of nice streaking and
opalescence like blues and pooling. The light blue on its own is a nice dove grey and it gives a very nice falling and streaking over the
plum.

Exhibited all the worst characteristics that Floating Blue can exhibit when not fired in optimal (tricky? randomly lucky?) conditions
for the glaze. Overall dull brown with THAT green where it would be nice if it was blue. Extremely similar to the original Floating

H: Alisa Clausen: a stable glaze with a myriad of variations in the surface and colour. Where thickest, surface was mattish, with a
greenish ground with almost lichen effect. Where application was dipped once, the surface is glossy, a dark brown, with light blue to
greenish flecks. Where it meets the double dipped surface, the flecking joins together to make the greenish overall ground. Iron oxide
painting underneath showed up under glaze. Inside the test bowl the surface is a dark brown with movement in the glaze causes some
blue streaking and pooling to bright cobalt blue gloss. I especially liked the merging of the matt surface to the gloss surface.

H: Alisa Clausen: an example of the blues, pinks and greens that Emmanuel Cooper says are possible with a glaze mix that has 1-3%
nickel, 20-50% barium carbonate and 10% zinc oxide. A never by me seen before tan matt with medium blue and moss green
speckling where once dipped, and a tan ground with larger pink, almost fuschia, pooling and speckling where double dipped. The
overall surface is flat and matt, and the pink speckling looks lichen like. Although this glaze is so high in barium, I would like to see it
on a bigger, textured pot. Stayed where it was applied.

F: rough
G: splitting
H: Alisa Clausen: a soft looking, but hard as stone rough, textured but smooth to touch surface. This slip is very interesting, because
you can paint it on and then, if you choose to brush some off or scratch into it, the slip holds your markings. It can be applied very
thickly and I got some splitting in the surface, but is very well attached to pot. Looks rocky and porous where thickest and whiter and
more translucent where thinnest. I cannot describe all the variables and nuances of this slip. It is very exciting and gives a subtle but
screaming gorgeous surface over my orange clay body. It colours well and it is possible to colour with stains and paints after the
firings. It is porous in some areas where really thick and I am sure very receptive to that sort of after firing handling. Where it came in
contact with ToDo white matt, it fused well to give yet another surface, a matt, smooth hard surface. Excellent with colorants that are
fluxes. Cobalt gave it a slightly more melted surface, with a grey and blue colour, good feel, handsome, understated blue. Stains fire
more or less to the same colour they are in the slurry, but dry as the original surface.

glassy shell of very opalescent blues and whites, with streaking and fuzzing, but no dripping. This test resembles Wolff Cream Gloss
in effect. I think it will be a good glaze for layering over others, like the Cream Gloss is. I have found almost any glossy base with 5%
Rutile makes for a good over glaze on rims for a streaking and opalescent effect.

to black is muted by a variegated shell surface with a greenish cast. Where the glaze is thickest, the colour becomes a warmer toffee
brown. Where thinnest, the glaze is more even in colour, which is a dark tenmoku-like brown, with black edges. This glaze will could
give a good play of colour with two different applications on the same work. Without RIO, a fat, semi-gloss white glaze. Milky where
thinner, opaque and white where thicker. Surface is smooth with some very small crystals. Pooled around edge where thickest but did

F: gloss
H: Candice Roeder: a nice fat cream to beige glaze, glossy but not garish. Breaks to reddish brown where thin. If your clay body has
much iron in it, the reddish breaking is quite pronounced, with speckles. I use it on white stoneware up to cone 7, and sometimes on
porcelain, though on porcelain it is less earthy looking. It is a nice neutral earth tone. Stores well, coats well. Well behaved and
forgiving. Dark slips used underneath will show through. In reduction it comes out brown.
H: Ron Roy: when I calculate this glaze and compare it to all three sets of limit formulas I use - with B2O3 in and out of unity - the
answer is always the same - this is a low fire glaze (08 at best.) At cone 6 it has less then half the alumina and silica needed for a stable
glaze at that temperature. One of the reasons unbalanced glazes like this are so attractive is: when there is more flux than needed for
melting the silica and alumina in the glaze, the flux starts looking for something to melt - that something is the clay (mostly the silica
part of clay) it is on. Most of us like that effect (breaking on edges etc.) - which comes more naturally in hi fire reduction.

area is double dipped it comes out whiter so it is sensitive to thickness and drips or runs want to be avoided unless the variation in
thickness and colour suits your pot. If fired above cone 8 it progresses to being shiny.

good glaze. It breaks a rich brown over texture.

silica it produces a white to orange mat glaze. It is quite beautiful on an iron body stoneware, with or without the silica. The glaze
when mixed without the silica likes strong reduction and a slow cool.

G: Ivor Lewis: unwashed wood ash glaze contains a large volume of potash-rich water. Potash is the principle melting agent in this
recipe. If you apply this to bisque ware the potash rich solution will soak into the porous fired clay and make no contribution to the
bulk of the glaze. Furthermore, once potash reaches its melting point it will react with silica forming potassium silicate and
discharging carbon dioxide. This will cause cratering and blistering.
G: Craig Martell: very low in both alumina and silica and will overfire and run.
H: Ingeborg Foco: I did some tests and I liked the results. The ash was maple, Douglas fir, scrub oak and 2x4s (spruce,pine,fir),
unwashed. Then I made a larger batch and had horrible results. Most of the pots ran heavily and had large craters and or blisters.
H: Lee Love: thin test tiles pick up much less of the glaze than the thickness of your average pot.

E: 0.6 cryolite
G: crawling
H: Hank Murrow: white where thick; red where thin. Best with early reduction firing with a long concluding period of oxidation, or a
soak in oxidation during cooling. Yields a very soft and fat surface with crawling. Crawls more strongly if fired soon after glazing.
Note the low (3.3:1) silica to alumina ratio. Cryolite seems to deepen the colour. Perhaps while outgassing, the fluorine content carries
iron from the clay to the glaze surface. Low-melt spodumene contributes phosphorus, which (as in Shaner Red) also helps the fire
colour. McNamee kaolin is a Georgia clay having a lovely blush of colour in the wood fire, probably because of its iron/titanium
content, which is also beneficial in Shinos; Helmer kaolin can be substituted.
H: Tony Clennell: Shino glazes must be made at least 24 hours before use. Screen them each day before using, this helps get the
thickness more even. Thickness has a huge impact on the look of CT glazes. We glaze everything that day, load and candle overnight.
Reduction begins at 012 just beginning to tip, then reduction with a climb in temperature ( the oxyprobe is just over 6) a higher reading
than 7 is creating smoke but I think is interfering with reduction. We climb to Cone 9 in medium reduction again at around oxyprobe
6- 6.5 and slow the kiln down at cone 9 for an hour soak till 10 is down.

lovely things over Floating blue and Raspberry as well as with other glazes. It fits Standard Ceramic clay 112 (same as 225) and
everything else that has come from there as far as I know (the studio has gone through quite a number of different clays and has not

E: 3 cobalt carbonate
H: Tim Eberhardt: I have used it as a base and as a salvation treatment for work that comes through the glaze fire with less than
satisfactory results for 5 years with no problems. Take the cobalt out and you get a satiny white glaze that you can add stains and
oxides to in order to get a palette of colours. The hotter you fire the less it will have the crystally look and the bluer the glaze will
become. The cooler, the more purple and pink you will see. If you use this over previously fired pieces, what is underneath will affect
the outcome somewhat. I spray a couple of coats over pots I think require salvation. It always works miracles. Increase the borate to 21
for cone 6.
H: Ron Roy: way short of alumina so it is not going to be durable - best not to use it as a liner. Because it is short of alumina it may be
runny. The expansion is a bit on the low side so adding a low expansion material like zirconia could be risky.
H: Steve Slatin: because this is magnesium rich, low in alumina and high in silica, it will react with the underlying glaze and not just
provide a new layer of effects (granted, a refiring with a second coat of glaze always does this to some extent). The effects will include
new colour effects because magnesium-rich glazes often have different colour effects from Na/K based glazes, and provide a more
varied effect as the lower levels of the glaze surface will include mostly the original colouration and the top layer, rich in Mg, will
include the other colouration, and there may be crystalline effects because of the extremely high Si:Al ratio of the salvation treatment,
and there may be internal refraction because of the difference in glass characteristics between the already-established normal
flux/silica-ratio glass on the pot surface vs the extra-high ratio salvation surface lying on top of it. Why doesn't it run off the pot? My
guess here is that Eberhardt mixes it much as he mixes his regular glaze, and then brushes or dips a much thinner layer of the salvation
onto the already glazed pot than he would use if it were a base glaze (which is easy enough -- its tough to put a thick layer over a
glazed surface). This thin layer when fired is sufficient to create effects but not so thick as to run all over.

settle it not only is hard to get back into solution but it does not seem to fire the same. Works well with a lot of other glazes.

two because the results seem to alter somewhat as the glaze ages a bit. The glaze must be fired in a medium to a heavy reduction to get
the results I want.

H: Mel Jacobson: this glaze was found written on the side of plastic pail I bought at an auction in 1965. As with all mirror blacks the
thickness of the glaze, the quality of the reduction, and the care in cooling the kiln will play a dramatic influence on the final product.
Breaking to rust is the result of thin areas. If you wish to use this as iron red just apply a thin coat. As most veteran potters will verify:
make 2000 pots, apply mirror black glaze, and fire the kiln 73 times, you will learn to use it.

to copper brushwork on a pot on the celadon colours. With 5 zinc oxide, the colours you get will depend a lot on your clay body and
your firing schedule. With 2 red iron oxide plus 0.5 chrome oxide plus 0.25 cobalt oxide, dark speckled green on stoneware, hunter on
porcelain. With 5 tin dioxide plus 1 red iron oxide plus 1 chrome oxide plus 0.25 cobalt oxide, a beautiful green. With 2 red iron oxide
plus 2 black copper oxide, a warm, speckled, reddish brown. With 2 black iron oxide, a good blue celadon. If you want it bluer you can
do a variation with 1-2% black iron oxide and .25% cobalt carbonate.

H: Rod Wuetherick: Copper red glazes are by nature finicky. The nicest copper reds have very low amounts of copper in them, usually
less than 1% added to the batch. Tin will help stabilize the copper a bit, but this is not a silver bullet by any means. If you start going
over 1% the copper reds are livery in appearance and not personally my favourite but some like it. Copper reds are really all about the
firing process, moderate reduction not heavy; 5.5 - 6.0 on the oxy-probe. I have found the zinc to be useless and think it is an old
school glaze addition in reduction firings. According to most sources it just volatilizes, and how much it takes part in the melt is of
constant debate. I can tell you from my experience that I have never noticed a difference in high fire reduction glazes if you leave out
the zinc. Fire almost as fast as you can, extended firings tend to show your copper where the stack is and it finds its way up there
without further encouragement.

H: Daniel Kirkland: fire either in oxidation or in neutral, reduce when the kiln is cooling. From cone 10, close the damper, let the kiln
cool to a very dull red colour (cone 018 to 016), then turn the gas back on and reduce heavily for anywhere between 20 minutes and 1
hour. Consistently comes out as a very rich deep red.
H: Karin Givon: I start the reduction at cone 011, reduce it for about half an hour or so, then keep the kiln in light reduction for the rest
of the fire, tried many recipes and they all work pretty well with this schedule.
H: Wyndham Dennison: My reduction starts at 015 where I have the six venturi burners paps open to one turn open and the damper
closed to give a wisp of smoke out the bottom peek of my downdraft. The top reaches reduction first then the bottom 30 min later. I
balance the damper to keep the back pressure where a lick of flame is coming out the bottom peek. After about 3 hr I open the PAPS
another half turn then as the kiln heats up to cone 6 I open the PAPS another half turn and open the damper so as to have the mim back
pressure but still some. As my kiln heats it creates its own fire storm and the draft starts running hard at about 2000F so I have to
watch and maybe push in the damper to control the ox/reduc ratio. If I reduce too heavily then I get a muddy liver coloured red, but in
this kiln, good bright reds come from a light to neutral from cone 6 to cone 10 in about 9-10 hr for a about a 45 cu ft stack.

H: Craig Martell: tenmokus are more expressive than glazes that are loaded with metals to make them black. Tenmokus are fine for
food use too, as you stated. Warren Mackenzie told me once that he preferred tenmokus above all other glazes for dinner plates
because food looked so good on this type of glaze. I sold some black tenmoku plates to a chef at the Park City Art Festival some time
