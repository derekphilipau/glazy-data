note = |the original recipe, and it differs from the one Sharon posted. You might try this version in your tests. It is
note = |called Floating Blue...from James Chappell's book, Clay and Glazes.
note = |This glaze produces a deep blue-brown background of great depth with
note = |lighter mottled blues that seem to float on the surface of the
note = |background glaze. The glaze has more of the lighter mottled blues
note = |where the application is thickest. Watch thickness near the bottom of
note = |the pot. The C.M.C. measurement refers to a premixed CMC and water
note = |solution. For the Silica, I use 325 mesh Flint. The rutile, is just
note = |powdered rutile from the ceramics supply. It fires best on the light
note = |side of cone 6 (standard cone just bending), seems to get greener and
note = |more fluid the higher you go. Cone 5 works well, too. I do not find a
note = |need for bentonite. The book says to weigh the ingredients very
note = |carefully, use distilled water or water that is known to have a low
note = |mineral content. Mix then add the CMC solution. Sieve two or three
note = |times through a 60 to 80 mesh sieve to thoroughly disperse the
note = |cobalt, iron, and rutile. The book warns that the glaze is fickle,
note = |and recommends against firing this glaze in the same kiln with glazes
note = |that contain copper, chrome, nickel or manganese. Mineral content of
note = |the water is an important factor. I have noticed an adverse effect as
note = |the author noted, and now fire an entire kiln load of this glaze. The
note = |glaze should be stirred occasionally during application because the
note = |iron has a tendency to settle. Chappell's Suggested variations:
note = |Stipple on additional glaze with brush or apply with sponge for an
note = |even more mottled effect. Or: lightly sponge a thin wash of 3 grams
note = |of chrome oxide to 100 grams of water plus a tablespoon of CMC over
note = |the top to produce a floating blue glaze with subtle green tints. Or:
note = |Over the glaze, sponge lightly with a rutile wash consisting of 2
note = |grams rutile per 100g of water for a floating blue glaze with
note = |slightly tan crystalline tints on the surface. submitted by: Candice

note = |wondering if Ron Wright is getting more bubbles because he is trying

note = |
note = |*Where is it used?
note = | Anne Arundel Community College
note = |
note = |*Where did this recipe come from?

note = |
note = |*Is this glaze reliable?
note = | Yes, very.
note = |
note = |*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.?
note = | We have had some crawling when it is applied thickly or overlapped
note = |heavily with other glazes. Controlling the thickness is essential.
note = |
note = |*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze?
note = | It seems to stand up well to temperature variations.  When it is
note = |hotter it will tend to go more translucent.
note = |
note = |*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies?
note = | The color is pretty powerful.  Over a stoneware body in reduction it
note = |will go a bit darker, and it will be brighter and bluer over a white
note = |body.
note = |
note = |*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping?

note = |
note = |*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot?
note = | Medium, a full 3 second dip is adequate.

note = |*How does this glaze interact with other glazes?
note = | It breaks up nicely and goes to a navy blue when used with our clear
note = |glaze.
note = |
note = |*What is your kiln type and size?
note = | Most of our work with it has been in an Alpine 20 natural gas kiln.
note = |We have also used it in a 23" dia. L&L econo kiln.  The colors in
note = |oxidation are a bit lighter, and the surface is not as smooth.
note = |
note = |*How do you typically fire?
note = | The gas schedule is just 7.5 to 8 hours to reach cone 6.  We fire
note = |between cone 6 and 7.  Reduction starts at cone 010, and continues to
note = |cone 6, with the dampers being opened gradually as the firing gets
note = |closer to completion, but we maintain reduction to the end. No soak.
