note = |blue-green. Then, experimenting, we cooled the kiln faster to match
note = |the curve of the electrics. Voila, nice sharp crystals and blue. It
note = |also seems to be quite sensitive to temperature, over fire it and it
note = |grabs iron from anywhere and goes blue green or brownish. I also
note = |might note that it is quite sensitive to application. It must go on
note = |thick to develop a good blue. (even sometimes giving almost purple).
note = |Thick in the bucket, double dip as soon as the sheen leaves, dry
note = |completely, then rub lightly everywhere and especially on compund
note = |curves. This is a Cornwall recipe and tends to crawl if not thorughly

note = |Don't know what it might do at c6 but if you can get it there, the
note = |above notes might help. One note, I mentioned that it's sensitive to

note = |first started using it in electric firing, and a year ago switched to
note = |gas. At first in the gas, it was muddier and tended toward rutile
note = |blue-green. Then, experimenting, we cooled the kiln faster to match
note = |the curve of the electrics. Voila, nice sharp crystals and blue. It
note = |also seems to be quite sensitive to temperature, over fire it and it
note = |grabs iron from anywhere and goes blue green or brownish. I also
note = |might note that it is quite sensitive to application. It must go on
note = |thick to develop a good blue. (even sometimes giving almost purple).
note = |Thick in the bucket, double dip as soon as the sheen leaves, dry
note = |completely, then rub lightly everywhere and especially on compund
note = |curves. This is a Cornwall recipe and tends to crawl if not thorughly
note = |bonded to the clay surface. The thickness required doesn't help.
note = |Don't know what it might do at c6 but if you can get it there, the
note = |above notes might help. One note, I mentioned that it's sensitive to
note = |temp. It's happiest between 9-1/2 and 10-1/2. Also we use it on a
note = |white stoneware. On iron body clays, it tends toward blue green or
note = |brown-green...not too pretty. Joyce brought up a good pointThe rutile
note = |blue Moonlight from Conrad (G375) is r understand, most rutile blues
note = |are. The way we work around this is to provide a ridge at the foot
note = |and, when Betsy applies the glaze, she takes a stainless rib and
note = |carves a taper into the ridge. Sounds time consuming, and is, but it
note = |goes pretty fast after you've done (not had) a few. The main time we
note = |lose pieces from running now is where there's an overlap with another
note = |glaze, especially Temmoku. But by keeping it high on the pot, it can

note = |I have a revised glaze for you. But first let
note = |me tell you a bit about your current recipe. As you gave it, this
note = |glaze is a high alkaline earth glaze, a bit low in alumina, but
note = |otherwise smack in the midfire range c4-c7. It's unusual in the fact
note = |that it has 5.2% Titanium oxide and this will cause problems,
note = |pinholing being one of them. The glaze is prone to pinholing because
note = |there's too much carbonate in the raw materials. The COE at 7.2 is a
note = |bit high but it could well fit a stoneware of 6.+ COE. Ok. Here's the
note = |new version. This version closely matches the Unity Formula of your
note = |original. I have switched to Wollastonite and Talc to reduce the
note = |carbonate level. You could also use copper oxide black 40 units, or
note = |copper oxide red, 35 units and reduce the carbonate a bit more but
note = |the copper oxides are very hard to disperse and you may get speckling
note = |if you do not thoroughly screen the mix. The gerstley borate is
note = |higher than I'd wish but if I use Ferro frit 3134 (or 3195) in its
note = |place the alumina goes up almost 50% and the KNaO content goes up
note = |too, increasing the COE to 7.7 or higher; the glaze could craze
note = |markedly. The best course would be to try this mix first and see if
note = |it gives you the blue-green you want without pinholes. If out-gassing
note = |is still a problem, then perhaps one could use half Gerstley B and
note = |half 3195. I suggest, if this sits ok with you, that you go this
note = |route and see what happens and only make a further revision if
note = |needed. Tom Buck <aa563@main.freenet.hamilton.on.ca> Sana's Green is

note = |From Pete Pinnell, Clay Times Mar/Apr 2005 p. 21. The phosphorus contributes a
note = |number of qualifies to the glaze. It is a glass-former (like the silica), but the
note = |phosphorus and silica don't like to mix together (sort of like oil and water).
note = |This means that in the firing, the phosphorus tends to separate out and form a
note = |cloudy, slightly opalescent milkiness that I find very interesting. It also has a
note = |strong tendency to re-oxidize colorants in a glaze, which can result in unusual,
note = |vivid colors that have the richness of reduction firing, combined with the
note = |intensity of oxidation colors. A side effect of the phosphorus is that the glaze
note = |now resists going matte. It will if pushedthat is, if the cooling is slow enough,
note = |or if the piece is refired in a bisque kiln to allow enough time for the matting
note = |crystals to grow. Otherwise, it is a glossy glaze. The next step (after coming up
note = |with the base glaze) was to try out all the common glaze colorants and see what
note = |they did in this glaze. The results are fascinating, and many are beautiful. I'm
note = |currently in the process of developing more complex colors involving multiple
note = |oxides, and I'll pass those along in a future column.
note = |
note = |If you've ever mixed a tomato red glaze, you'll notice that it always includes a
note = |source of magnesium (such as talc or dolomite) and either natural or synthetic
note = |bone ash (a source of phosphorus). Together with iron and the other components,
note = |these create iron crystals, and push them into an oxidized state. As I suspected
note = |it would, Pete's CIA produces a bright tomato red with 7 or 8% red iron oxide. As
note = |the amount of iron increases to 10 or 11%, the glaze becomes quite crystalline,
note = |but just a bit more brown. The red can be made brighter by refiring it (after the
note = |glaze firing) in a bisque firing, or in any low-fire oxidation firing.2 Manganese
note = |dioxide makes a beautiful yellow (really!) in small percentages, becoming a creamy
note = |red-amber at higher percentages. Copper carbonate, which normally wants to turn a
note = |pink or red color in reduction, instead produces light blue-green to emerald
note = |green. It works from 1 to 9%. Titanium dioxide or ruffle produce very nice
note = |breaking and mottling, working best at 4 and 5%. The effect shows up best on
note = |stoneware, but also works well on porcelain with the addition of a small amount of
note = |another oxide (iron or copper, for instance) in addition to the titania. Tin oxide
note = |produces white at smaller percent-ages, which begins to break rust on edges (even
note = |on porcelain) as it nears 10%, with very pronounced cream and orange colors pro-
note = |duced on stoneware at 10% and 12%. Like the iron colors I mentioned above, it will
note = |become more orange when refired in a bisque or other low-fire oxidation firing.
note = |Frankly, I thought the results from cobalt and chrome were very boring, but that
note = |might be my taste in colors. Cobalt produced pasty, pastel blues. Chrome was nice
note = |in very tiny amounts0.3% made a nice, very light blue-green, but larger amounts
note = |produced dull greenish browns. Please keep in mind that this is a new glaze, and I
note = |don't have extensive experience with it. I've used it (in several color
note = |variations) in a half dozen or so firings, and it is very promising, but I have
